<h1> Liftshare Interview Code Challange: Lifshare Route Planner </h1>
<p> This application demonstrates my ability to work with typescript React to implement API solutions to a real world problem faced at Liftshare </p>
<small> aware that the Liftshare stack was using Vue, I did what I could with the knowlege of frontend frameworks I had. React is lightweight and something I was experienced with so decided this was most appropriate for this code test.</small>
